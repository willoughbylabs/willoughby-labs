# Willoughby Labs - Think. Learn. Do.
*Personal website and playground for practicing what I learn.*

Welcome to my laboratory! This site is where I apply concepts from learning, creating a historical record of a beginner’s journey through web development. As my capabilities improve, so too will the site and its features. 

Since the lab is a playground for learning, feedback is highly welcomed. Some suggested areas include:
- standards and best practices
- issues, pull requests, and collaborating with GitHub
- accessibility and usability
- clean code
- security

Please check out the [wiki](https://github.com/willoughbylabs/willoughby-labs/wiki) if you’d like to see future [intended features](https://github.com/willoughbylabs/willoughby-labs/wiki/Features----Learning) as I learn them, provide feedback or suggestions, or contribute in other ways, and thanks for visiting!
